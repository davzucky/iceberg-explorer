## 2026-01-16 - US-001
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-001 (Project Setup and Configuration) are met
- Confirmed pyproject.toml has FastAPI, DuckDB, Granian dependencies configured
- Verified source code structure in src/iceberg_explorer/
- Confirmed pre-commit hooks configured (ruff, pyupgrade)
- Verified project uses uv for dependency management
- All 324 tests pass with uv run pytest
- Ruff linting passes with uv run ruff check src/
- Code has type hints and Pydantic validation

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- This project uses uv for dependency management (not npm/pnpm)
- Quality checks: `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` and `uv run pytest`
- Typechecking is handled via Pydantic models and type hints (no mypy/pyright configured)
- Pre-commit hooks are in .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Source code is organized in src/iceberg_explorer/ with api/, models/, query/ subdirectories
- Tests are in tests/ directory matching source structure with test_ prefix

## 2026-01-16 - US-002
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-002 (Configuration System) are met
- Config loads from JSON file via ICEBERG_EXPLORER_CONFIG env var
- Env var overrides supported with ICEBERG_EXPLORER_ prefix (double underscore for nested)
- Pydantic models created: CatalogConfig, QueryConfig, DuckDBConfig, ServerConfig, ExportConfig, OTelConfig, Settings
- Both REST and local catalog types supported via CatalogType enum
- DuckDB memory limit and threads limits configurable in DuckDBConfig
- All optional settings have sensible defaults
- 21 config tests cover loading and validation
- All 324 tests pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Config system uses pydantic-settings with nested settings
- Env vars use ICEBERG_EXPLORER_ prefix with double underscore for nested values (e.g., ICEBERG_EXPLORER_QUERY__MAX_ROWS)
- Settings are cached globally via _settings variable
- Use reset_settings() in tests to clear cache
- JSON config file values are overridden by env vars
