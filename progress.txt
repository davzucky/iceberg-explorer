## Codebase Patterns
- Use `uv` for dependency management (uv sync, uv run pytest, uv run ruff check)
- Source code lives in `src/iceberg_explorer/` with packages: api/routes/, query/, models/, templates/
- Pre-commit hooks configured: ruff (lint/format), pyupgrade (Python 3.11+)
- Tests in `tests/` directory, run with `uv run pytest`

- What was implemented:
  - Created pyproject.toml with FastAPI, DuckDB, Granian, OpenTelemetry dependencies
  - Set up src/iceberg_explorer/ package structure with api/routes, query, models, templates subdirs
  - Configured pre-commit hooks with ruff and pyupgrade
  - Created README.md with development instructions
  - Created basic test to verify version
- Files changed:
  - pyproject.toml (new)
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml (new)
  - README.md (new)
  - src/iceberg_explorer/__init__.py (new)
  - src/iceberg_explorer/main.py (new)
  - src/iceberg_explorer/api/__init__.py (new)
  - src/iceberg_explorer/api/routes/__init__.py (new)
  - src/iceberg_explorer/query/__init__.py (new)
  - src/iceberg_explorer/models/__init__.py (new)
  - tests/__init__.py (new)
  - tests/test_main.py (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - hatchling build backend requires README.md to exist if referenced in pyproject.toml
  - Use `uv sync --all-extras` to install dev dependencies
  - pytest-asyncio requires `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` setting in pyproject.toml for Python 3.14
