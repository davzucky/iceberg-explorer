## Codebase Patterns

## Fri Jan 17 00:35:00 AM JST 2026 - US-001
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified .devcontainer/ directory structure exists at repository root
- Verified devcontainer.json has valid JSON schema
- Verified docker-compose.yml exists for multi-container orchestration
- Fixed Dockerfile issue: uv --version was called before uv was installed
  - Combined uv installation and version check into single RUN command
- Verified Dockerfile builds successfully with docker build
- Validated devcontainer.json and docker-compose.yml using Python json/yaml parsers
- All 324 tests pass with uv run pytest
- Ruff linting passes with uv run ruff check src/ tests/

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Devcontainer structure uses: .devcontainer/devcontainer.json, .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml, .devcontainer/Dockerfile
- Base image: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.14
- Python's json module validates JSON, PyYAML validates YAML structure
- Dockerfile RUN commands should be combined when dependencies exist between them (pip install && uv --version)
- Quality checks: `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` and `uv run pytest`
- Pre-commit hooks automatically fix trailing whitespace and missing newlines
