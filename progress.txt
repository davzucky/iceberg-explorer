## 2026-01-16 - US-001
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-001 (Project Setup and Configuration) are met
- Confirmed pyproject.toml has FastAPI, DuckDB, Granian dependencies configured
- Verified source code structure in src/iceberg_explorer/
- Confirmed pre-commit hooks configured (ruff, pyupgrade)
- Verified project uses uv for dependency management
- All 324 tests pass with uv run pytest
- Ruff linting passes with uv run ruff check src/
- Code has type hints and Pydantic validation

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- This project uses uv for dependency management (not npm/pnpm)
- Quality checks: `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` and `uv run pytest`
- Typechecking is handled via Pydantic models and type hints (no mypy/pyright configured)
- Pre-commit hooks are in .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Source code is organized in src/iceberg_explorer/ with api/, models/, query/ subdirectories
- Tests are in tests/ directory matching source structure with test_ prefix
