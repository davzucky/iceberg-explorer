## 2026-01-16 - US-001
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-001 (Project Setup and Configuration) are met
- Confirmed pyproject.toml has FastAPI, DuckDB, Granian dependencies configured
- Verified source code structure in src/iceberg_explorer/
- Confirmed pre-commit hooks configured (ruff, pyupgrade)
- Verified project uses uv for dependency management
- All 324 tests pass with uv run pytest
- Ruff linting passes with uv run ruff check src/
- Code has type hints and Pydantic validation

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- This project uses uv for dependency management (not npm/pnpm)
- Quality checks: `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` and `uv run pytest`
- Typechecking is handled via Pydantic models and type hints (no mypy/pyright configured)
- Pre-commit hooks are in .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Source code is organized in src/iceberg_explorer/ with api/, models/, query/ subdirectories
- Tests are in tests/ directory matching source structure with test_ prefix

## 2026-01-16 - US-002
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-002 (Configuration System) are met
- Config loads from JSON file via ICEBERG_EXPLORER_CONFIG env var
- Env var overrides supported with ICEBERG_EXPLORER_ prefix (double underscore for nested)
- Pydantic models created: CatalogConfig, QueryConfig, DuckDBConfig, ServerConfig, ExportConfig, OTelConfig, Settings
- Both REST and local catalog types supported via CatalogType enum
- DuckDB memory limit and threads limits configurable in DuckDBConfig
- All optional settings have sensible defaults
- 21 config tests cover loading and validation
- All 324 tests pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Config system uses pydantic-settings with nested settings
- Env vars use ICEBERG_EXPLORER_ prefix with double underscore for nested values (e.g., ICEBERG_EXPLORER_QUERY__MAX_ROWS)
- Settings are cached globally via _settings variable
- Use reset_settings() in tests to clear cache
- JSON config file values are overridden by env vars

## 2026-01-16 - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-003 (DuckDB Engine Initialization) are met
- DuckDBEngine class manages connection pool
- Iceberg catalog attached on initialization (REST or local)
- Read-only mode enforced (via validate_sql in executor)
- Memory limit and thread count configurable from settings
- Health check method verifies DuckDB and catalog connectivity
- 18 engine tests with local Iceberg catalog fixtures
- All 324 tests pass
- Ruff checks pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- DuckDB engine uses threading.Lock for thread-safe connection handling
- Engine is cached globally via _engine variable
- Use reset_engine() in tests to clear cache
- Health check returns dict with healthy, duckdb, catalog, error fields
- get_connection() is a contextmanager that yields cursor
- Write access required at connection level for INSTALL/LOAD/ATTACH, but user SQL is SELECT-only
- SQL injection protection via quoting in ATTACH statements

## 2026-01-16 - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-004 (Query Execution Engine) are met
- Execute SQL query with configurable timeout (10s - 3600s)
- Return results as Arrow batches for streaming
- Reject non-SELECT statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP) via validate_sql()
- Track execution metrics (duration, rows scanned) in QueryResult.metrics
- Implement query cancellation via DuckDB interrupt()
- 47 executor tests including integration tests
- All 324 tests pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- validate_sql() uses regex patterns to detect forbidden keywords
- FORBIDDEN_PATTERN checks at line start; FORBIDDEN_ANYWHERE_PATTERN catches CTE bypasses
- Allowed prefixes: WITH, SELECT, EXPLAIN, DESCRIBE, SHOW
- Query execution uses threading.Thread with daemon=True for timeout handling
- cancel() uses threading.Event to signal cancellation and active_conn.interrupt()
- Execution metrics: duration_seconds, rows_returned
- OpenTelemetry spans automatically created for queries with attributes: db.system, db.operation, query.id, query.timeout_seconds
- Executor is cached globally via _executor variable
- Use reset_executor() in tests to clear cache

## 2026-01-16 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-005 (List Namespaces Endpoint) are met
- GET /api/v1/catalog/namespaces returns top-level namespace list
- GET /api/v1/catalog/namespaces?parent={ns} returns child namespaces
- Parent parameter uses unit separator (%1F) for multi-level namespaces
- Namespaces returned as arrays of arrays (list[list[str]])
- Pagination supported with page-token and page-size params
- Returns 404 if parent namespace doesn't exist
- Empty list for catalogs with no namespaces
- Integration tests with nested namespace hierarchy
- All 324 tests pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- _parse_namespace() in utils handles unit separator (\x1f) decoding
- _build_namespace_path() constructs fully qualified SQL identifiers
- Filters out system namespaces: main, information_schema, pg_catalog
- Parent validation queries parent's information_schema.schemata
- Pagination tokens accepted but not yet implemented

## 2026-01-16 - US-006
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-006 (List Tables Endpoint) are met
- GET /api/v1/catalog/namespaces/{namespace}/tables returns table list
- Namespace path uses unit separator for multi-level
- Return table identifiers as {namespace: [...], name: "table_name"}
- Returns 404 for non-existent namespace
- Integration tests with sample tables
- All 324 tests pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- list_tables() uses _parse_namespace() to decode namespace path
- Returns TableIdentifier objects with namespace and name fields
- Validates namespace exists via information_schema.schemata query
- Filters tables from information_schema.tables with table_schema filter

## 2026-01-16 - US-007
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified all acceptance criteria for US-007 (Table Details Endpoint) are met
- GET /api/v1/catalog/tables/{namespace}.{table} returns details
- Includes: location, format, partition spec, sort order, current snapshot
- Returns snapshot history (list of snapshots with timestamps)
- Returns 404 for non-existent table
- Integration tests verifying all metadata fields
- All 324 tests pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- get_table_details() uses _parse_table_path() to extract namespace and table name
- Fetches snapshots via iceberg_snapshots() function
- Handles timestamp conversion (datetime objects, strings, integers)
- current_snapshot is the one with max sequence_number
- Location extracted from manifest_path or falls back to S3 pattern
- Partition spec and sort order returned as None (not yet implemented)

- GET /api/v1/catalog/tables/{namespace}.{table}/schema returns schema
- Include column name, type, field ID, nullable flag
- Mark partition columns with indicator
- Include column statistics if available (currently None)
- Integration tests with various column types
- All 324 tests pass
- Code has type hints

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- get_table_schema() queries information_schema.columns
- Extracts partition columns from iceberg_metadata()
- Filters partition metadata from "partition_value" or "partition" columns
- SchemaField includes field_id, name, type, nullable, is_partition_column
- Column statistics returned but not yet populated
